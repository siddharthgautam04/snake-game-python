created a snake game app using pygames library 
i have also used randint module to to give random positions to the fruits that will spawn on the map.
Also, I imported time to keep track of how long I have been playing the game for.
some features of the gae are collissiion detection ,score updation and and use pygame.flip() to refresh the screen.
